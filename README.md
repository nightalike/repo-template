# Repo Template

Template to make every repository a good repository.

## Note

This repository is a fork of
[**toolbi-org/repo-template**](https://github.com/toolbi-org/repo-template).

## Why?

Managing a lot of repositories is hard, and it's even harder when you want all
repositories to be perfect. This allows us to at least have a solid start every
single time.
